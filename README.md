# DesktopPhotoFrame

Small python Tk application that can be used as a digital photo frame on your desktop. 

Simpy said: It's a small slide show viewer with the following extras:
* Borderless window
* Always on the foreground.
* No wasted window area around photo
* Automatic docking to outmost window corner

## Borderless window
The photo window is free of borders and static buttons, to let it look like a real photo as much as possible. (Conflicts a bit with the name DesktopPhoto**Frame** :-) )
  
## Always on the foreground
The photo window stays on the foreground, even when other windows are put at the same position.

## No wasted window area around photo
The photo window size is adapted to the scaled photo size, to prevent waste of window area around the photo. The longest size of the photo is scaled to a predefined percentage of the screen height. 

## Automatic docking to outmost window corner 
When switching between different photos, the outmost window corner (closest to a screen corner) is kept stable to prevent the photo window from 'jumping' over the screen.

The picture below shows how the docking works when switching between portait and landscape oriÃ«nted photos.

The red dot represents the outmost window corner in each of the four screen quadrants.
